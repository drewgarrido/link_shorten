# Overview
A bitly clone, storing a user input URL and providing a shorter URL to refer
others to. This shortened URL points to the application server and provides a
redirect page to the original user URL.

This link shortener was a part of an interview question challenge, made in
about 2.5 hours. I've never used Flask before, and was pleased with how easy a
webserver was created with its use.

# Starting the server application
python shorten.py

Point a browser to localhost:5000 to see the page.
